        <finished>Thank you! I really thought I would never find my papers... @You just saved my life! I owe you something...</finished>
        <already-started>The quest is already underway. Could you come back when you @have found my papers to give them back to me?</already-started>
        <content>Hi there. I'm Grossali. I recently arrived in this city@ but I lost my papers. I cannot continue to live here any @longer because the city hall wants proof that I am a resident here.@ For that, you have to find my identity papers. I seem to have lost my@ identity papers on the ground when I was walking around. @Could you help me? I have a little bit of money that @I could give you, that will allow you to enjoy your stay!</content>

    <discuss>I recently arrived and I love this city. What makes me @want to continue here is my work. I take care of @the forest that surrounds us. It's a lot of work to @take care of it! I hope you will enjoy this city, @I think it is beautiful. Don't hesitate to visit other @people in the city, they are just as nice as what @I am describing now. I spent 23 years of my @life in a former city, LelCity. It was frankly @not great, I don't have great memories of it. @The neighbors were loud and didn't know @how to be respectful. Not a hello, nothing. @I think I really belong here.</discuss>
