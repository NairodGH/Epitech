Legend:
    ^v = the player height increases/decreases by 1 block
    ! = the player falls if he doesn't press the space bar
    0123456789<> = blocks constituting the map
    @ = player position
    $ = level end
    You can modify everything according to the shown above pattern;
    -1rst line for the player height increase/decrease (stackable with falls)
    -2nd line for the player falls (stackable with the height changes)
    -of course there must be an end
    -map can be as long (and as high depending on the window size) as you want but the whole has to be rectangle-shaped (space = air)
    -the very bottom-left of the map has to be a block (reference block) with the player starting above (no matter the starting height)
    -none of the above rules apply if you want to make a cool glitchy level ;) Have fun !
