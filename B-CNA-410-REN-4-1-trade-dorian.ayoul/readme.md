# B-CNA-410 Trade

```
Trade is a 2nd year Epitech project.
The program, written in the language we want,
has to parse the settings and infos given by a workspace tool
based on .csv files containing trading BTC_USDT candlestick chart data.
Once some candlesticks have been analyzed,
it must appropriately buy/sell/wait for the remaining ones (and hopefully earn money by the end).
```

# How to setup

- Compile the trade exectuable in the repository root with make
- Get the ai bot workspace from github github.com/jmerle/ai-bot-workspace/releases/
- Once downloaded and in the root, lauch and select the "Crypto Trader" Competition
- Got to File -> Settings (top left) and leave every field to default except Command: ./trade
- "Save" and "Run match" to see the result
