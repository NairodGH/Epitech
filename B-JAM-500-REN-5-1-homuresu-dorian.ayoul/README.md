## 🔍 About

Can also be found at https://github.com/NairodGH/Homuresu

[Homuresu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homelessness) is a 3rd year game JAM Epitech project where a group of 3-6 (but we're 8 lol) students have to code a 3D FPS about superheroes/supervillains shooting each other.\

## 💻 Requirements

Supported operating systems:
- Windows (tested on Windows 10 Home 21H1 x64)
- Linux (tested on Ubuntu 2204 and Fedora 32)
- MacOS

Dependencies:
- [Cmake](https://cmake.org/download/) 3.24+
- [OpenGL](https://www.opengl.org/)

## 🔧 Building

Launch `homuresu.sh` (linux/MacOS) or `homuresu.bat` (Windows) to start the building of the project.
It will automatically:
- Download/build the [Raylib](https://www.raylib.com/)
- Build the `homuresu` and `homureserver` executables (.exe on Windows) using those libraries

## 🎮 Usage

One person has to start `homureserver` to be the server host and can also start `homuresu` to be a player.
The other players just have to start `homuresu` on their end aswell.
